###Simple Calculator

A simple calculator project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating a user interface with buttons for numbers 
and basic arithmetic operations. The HTML sets up the structure, the CSS styles the elements for a visually pleasing layout,
and the JavaScript handles the functionalityâ€”allowing users to input numbers and operations, display the input/output, 
and perform calculations when the equals button is clicked.
It's an excellent starting point for beginners to 
understand the fundamentals of web development and user interaction within a small, manageable project.
